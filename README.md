# WalkBoxes Reader/Converter

This is an application designed for reading and converting **.wbox files (WalkBoxes)**. (In the future, it will also be possible to do it in reverse and modify .wbox files)

**If there are any issues PLEASE report them to [HERE](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/WalkBoxes-Converter/issues)**

## DISCLAIMER (Please Read)
This is currently being developed and tested only with ***"The Walking Dead Telltale Definitive Series"***. (for the time being)

- Only supports **The Walking Dead Definitive Edition** *(for the time being)*

This is a console app, and it will spit out a .json file of the telltale .wbox file. As for what you wish to do with the file it can be whatever, first goal of the project was getting a readable .wbox file.

### Developers

**If you want to learn about the file format** I suggest you look in the **[Program.cs](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/WalkBoxes-Converter/blob/main/app-console/wbox-console/wbox-console/WalkBoxes_File.cs)** script, it's is well documented and describes the .wbox format well.
